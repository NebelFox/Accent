# Accent
Android application for studying accents in the Ukrainian language. Made with Corona SDK (now Solar 2D). The list of words is currently outdated.

## Progress
It divides into 2 parts:
* Global - represents your correctness from the very beginning. Can't be reset from the app.
* Weekly - represents your correctness during the current week. Gets reset every Monday 00:00.

## Settings
Currently only 2 options are available:
* Vibration - whether the app vibrates when user makes a mistake.
* Theme - change the app appearance between light and dark.
